    "# Collective.jl: A tool for finding patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Collective.jl is a Julia package designed to identify interesting *features* from a collection of words. This is a common mechanic in puzzles you might find at, for example, the MIT Mystery Hunt. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter notebook using the Julia programming language to run Collective.jl. You can learn more about Jupyter notebooks at <http://jupyter.org/> and about Julia at [julialang.org](http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/introduction/). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use this package without installing Julia, you can use [juliabox](https://juliabox.com/). Just sign in at [juliabox.com](https://juliabox.com/) and upload this file. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "A *feature* is just a boolean property of a word, like `\"contains the letter 'a'\"` or `\"is a palindrome\"`. Many features can also include scalar quantities. For example, we might want to compute a family of features for a word's Scrabble score. Those features would look like: `\"scrabble score == 1\"`, `\"scrabble score == 2\"`, ..., `\"scrabble score == n\".` \n",
    "\n",
    "## Interestingness\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular set of words can satisfy many features. For example, if I give you the list of words: `[\"questionable\", \"businesswoman\", \"exhaustion\", \"discouraged\", \"communicated\", \"hallucinogen\", \"sequoia\"]`, you might tell me that they all contain the letter 'a'. That's true, but it's much more interesting to notice that they all contain *all 5 vowels*. We measure this degree of interestingness using the standard binomial probability distribution: given `n` words, we can compute the probability that `k` of them satisfy some feature `F` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t(n choose k) * f^k * (1 - f)^(n - k)\n",
    "\n",
    "where `f` is the frequency with wich feature `F` occurs in the population of words (in this case, the dictionary). The most interesting feature is the one whose probability of `k` occurrences is smallest. "
